### Stuff I don't want to lose track of

* [Gitter](https://gitter.im) - a chat system that integrates with your GitHub repository
* [Docker and Chef](https://www.chef.io/solutions/containers/) - using Chef to create, manage, and provision Docker containers
* [Hipchat and IRC](http://larryfox.us/writing/hipchat-with-irc/) - why do I want to integrate everything back to IRC? Because IRC is the best thing

### Custom enclosures

* [Protocase](http://protocase.com/) - CAD-based enclosure
* [Front Panel Express](http://www.frontpanelexpress.com/) - customized front panes to be used in any number of precreated enclosures
* [Envision Plastics](http://www.envplastics.com/) - pretty sure this is just a 3d-printing shop
