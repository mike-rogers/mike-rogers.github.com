Yeah, you **don't** have time. Every heartbeat, every breath, every photon that strikes your retina is another discrete event from a large but painfully finite allocation that is irretrievably lost during your unceasing march towards death.

Or a deadline.

Did speaking that sentence buy you more time? Did it instill the same sense of focused urgency in others that you're feeling? Were those four words the optimal use of your time at that moment?

Probably not.

But we're human. We're inefficient. We're constantly fighting our primal nature, filled with evolutionary urges from our savannah-dwelling ancestors, moving continuously to avoid starvation and predation, making short and easy decisions to satiate our short-term hunger, oblivious to the long-term consequences.

But we're human. We are aware. We can use tools based on scientific method, statistics, and probability to overcome our instincts. We can't predict the future, but we can do the math and understand that when _this_ raw material goes into _this_ machine the resultant product will have _these_ characteristics within some tolerance, according to some confidence interval. And we can plan according to those data.

It is _so easy_ to lose that awareness. One crisis, one misstep, one unexpected happenstance can befoul the best laid plans, removing you from a solid path and flinging you squarely into a reactionary tempest, scrambling to relocate a sense of order, futilely yelling

> _"I don't have time!"_

Don't have time for what, exactly? Is your short-term need so great that you're willing to sacrifice your long-term wellbeing? Is the crisis you're in really as profound as you're feeling?

What are the consequences of ceasing your current task and getting back on track? Do you know them? If your deadline slips a single day will it cost you? Is that cost more than what you'll face in a week, a month, a year when the hedging and evasion catch up to you?

Take a breath.

Take another.

> _"I don't have time!"_

Yeah, you **don't** have time.

Be aware.
