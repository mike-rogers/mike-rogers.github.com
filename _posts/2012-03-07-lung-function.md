I love me some breathing.

Not a lot of people can appreciate what it's like to be gasping for breath in between coughs, [oxygen saturation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenation_%28medical%29) below 90%, fingernails turning blue, etc. I do this yearly, including occasional visits to the emergency room for IV steroids and delicious oxygen.

Did you know that medications delivered intravenously have a specific taste? It's a weird sensation.

Anyway, the most recent bout of **acute asthmatic bronchitis** has wiped me out for the past five weeks, which is wholly unacceptable. I saw a doctor at the Johnson County Immediate Care center on February 17th (with a clean chest X-ray, I might add), who suggested I visit an allergist to help get my asthma under control.

Today I visited the allergist.

There was a lung function test and a scratch panel consisting of 51 potential allergens (including 'goat' and 'pig').

* **Lung Function**: 67%
* **Total Allergens**: 51
* **Total Reactions**: 50

So now I'm on some new medications to help stabilize my asthma, because (as the doctor said) "untreated, those lungs will last you until maybe you're 50 years old". I was also given a device to measure my lungs' output, measured in liters/minute. I'm to take readings twice a day and record them.

I may try to add a graph to this site of my BID (twice a day) lung output readings...
