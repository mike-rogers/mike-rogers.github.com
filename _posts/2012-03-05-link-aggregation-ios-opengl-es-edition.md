The overall goal of this weekend was to create a [CocoaPod](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods) for a [Blender](http://www.blender.org) OBJ model file.

I definitely failed. Instead I moved my desk around and unclogged the bathroom sink.

I did however find a couple of links that will be of great help once I have a couple of hours to myself:

* [jlamarche's Blender Export project](https://github.com/jlamarche/iOS-OpenGLES-Stuff/tree/master/Blender%20Export)
* [Apple's OpenGL ES Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/3DDrawing/Conceptual/OpenGLES_ProgrammingGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008793-CH1-SW1)

Okay, honestly I thought there were more links, but checking my browsing history is a glimpse into ADHD madness. No wonder I never get more done.
